<p>Another theory is that the company’s name was inspired by World Cup 88, which was held in Seoul, South Korea. This theory is based on the assumption that the company was founded in South Korea.</p>
<p>There are also some theories that suggest that w88 is actually an acronym for something else. However, there is no evidence to support these theories.</p>

<h1 id="Who-was-Curie"><a href="#Who-was-Curie" class="headerlink" title="Who was Curie?"></a>Who was Curie?</h1><p>One of the most famous and renowned scientists to have ever lived was Curie. She was born in Warsaw, Poland in 1867 and died in 1934. Curie is best known for her work with radiation and radioactive materials. Curie is also one of only a few scientists to have won Nobel Prizes in two different scientific disciplines.</p>
<p>Curie’s parents were teachers and she was encouraged to study math and science from an early age. Curie attended the University of Warsaw where she studied physics and mathematics. After graduating, she continued her studies at the Sorbonne in Paris, France. While at the Sorbonne, Curie met Pierre Curie, a physicist who shared her interests in science. The two married in 1895 and together, they went on to do some of their most groundbreaking work in radiation.</p>
<p>One of the most famous discoveries that Curie and Pierre made was about radioactive materials. They discovered that uranium deposits emitted a type of energy that could pass through very thin materials like air or paper. This energy is now known as radiation. The Curies also invented the first portable x-ray machine using this energy.</p>

<h1 id="What-did-Curie-do"><a href="#What-did-Curie-do" class="headerlink" title="What did Curie do?"></a>What did Curie do?</h1><p>Marie Curie was a physicist and chemist who is best known for her work on radioactivity. She was the first person to win two Nobel Prizes, one in physics and one in chemistry. Curie also founded the research institute that is now known as the Curie Institute.</p>
<p>Curie’s work on radioactivity helped to unlock some of the secrets of the atom. She discovered that radioactive elements decayed over time, and she was able to measure the rate of decay. She also developed methods for separating uranium from other elements.</p>
<p>Curie’s work on radioactivity has had a significant impact on modern medicine. For example, her discoveries led to the development of radiation therapy, which is used to treat cancer patients.</p>
<p>Curie was an excellent scientist and she also had a strong dedication to her work. She was always willing to take risks and she never gave up when she encountered a challenge. Her work has had a lasting impact on the scientific community and she is considered to be one of the most important scientists of all time.</p>
