This is huge news for fans of the Star Wars galaxy, as Canto Bight is a fan favorite location.</p>
<p>The casino planet has been seen in several of the newer Star Wars movies, including The Last Jedi and Solo: A Star Wars Story. In those movies, it was shown as a lavish location full of casinos and high-class shops.

<h1 id="Casino-Planet-in-Star-Wars-Franchise-Getting-New-Name"><a href="#Casino-Planet-in-Star-Wars-Franchise-Getting-New-Name" class="headerlink" title="Casino Planet in Star Wars Franchise Getting New Name"></a>Casino Planet in Star Wars Franchise Getting New Name</h1><p>In an attempt to break away from the longstanding casino stereotype, Disney is renaming its casino planet in the “Star Wars” franchise to something more glamorous.</p>
<p>The new name has yet to be announced, but it’s said that the planet will be known as “Liberace.” The rebranding coincides with the debut of new “Star Wars” films set for release in December.</p>
<p>Casino Planet has been a part of the “Star Wars” franchise since 1977, when the first film was released. But with Disney’s recent purchase of Lucasfilm, the company is looking to make some changes.</p>
<p>According to insiders, the decision to rename Casino Planet was not an easy one. But with the release of new “Star Wars” films just months away, Disney felt that it was necessary to make a change.</p>
<p>“Casino Planet just doesn’t fit with our vision for the new ‘Star Wars’ films,” a Disney spokesperson said in a statement. “We want to create a more glamorous and exciting experience for fans, and Liberace is the perfect name for that.”</p>
<p>Fans of the “Star Wars” franchise have mixed reactions to the news. While some are excited about the prospect of a new and improved Casino Planet, others are worried that it will ruin their childhood memories.</p>
<p>Regardless of what fans think, it’s clear that Disney is determined to make a change. And with a new name like Liberace, Casino Planet is sure to be more popular than ever before.</p>
