        <h1 id="California’s-Gambling-Laws-Leave-Movies-and-Sports-Out-in-the-Cold"><a href="#California’s-Gambling-Laws-Leave-Movies-and-Sports-Out-in-the-Cold" class="headerlink" title="California’s Gambling Laws Leave Movies and Sports Out in the Cold"></a>California’s Gambling Laws Leave Movies and Sports Out in the Cold</h1><p>Californians have been able to gamble in casinos since the early 1930s, but state laws have not always been clear about what is and is not gambling. This has led to some unusual court rulings and to the state’s current gambling law, which makes a distinction between casino-type gambling and other types of gambling.</p>
<p>The first California gambling law was enacted in 1933. That law allowed card rooms, which were essentially private clubs where people could play poker and other games of chance for money. In 1940, the state legislature amended the law to allow betting on horse races.</p>
<p>In 1946, the California Supreme Court issued a ruling that clarified the state’s gambling laws. The court ruled that bingo was not a game of chance and thus was legal. The ruling also said that lotteries were not illegal, as had been claimed by some prosecutors.</p>
<p>In 1951, the state legislature enacted a comprehensive gambling law that regulated all forms of gambling in California. The law allowed card rooms and betting on horse races, but it prohibited all other types of gambling, including slot machines, roulette wheels, and craps tables.</p>
<p>In 1976, the California Supreme Court issued another important ruling related to gambling laws. The court ruled that poker was a game of chance and thus was not legal under the 1951 law. As a result of this ruling, most poker games in California took place in illegal underground casinos known as “card clubs.”</p>
<p>In 1991, the state legislature passed a new gambling law that made a distinction between casino-type gambling and other types of gambling. Casino-type gambling was allowed under the law, while other types of gambling were not. This distinction was based on how much skill was required to play the game. Games like blackjack, craps, and roulette were classified as casino-type games because they required little or no skill on the part of the players. Games like poker were classified as other types of games because they required more skill on the part of players.</p>
<p>This distinction still exists today under California’s current gambling law. Casino-type games are allowed under state law, while other types of games are not.</p>
<h1 id="California’s-Gambling-Laws-Are-Driving-Away-Businesses"><a href="#California’s-Gambling-Laws-Are-Driving-Away-Businesses" class="headerlink" title="California’s Gambling Laws Are Driving Away Businesses"></a>California’s Gambling Laws Are Driving Away Businesses</h1><p>A recent study by the The Los Angeles Times found that California’s gambling laws are driving businesses out of the state. According to the study, businesses are leaving California because its gambling laws are too complex and ambiguous. As a result, businesses are unable to operate in a legal and compliant manner.</p>
<p>The Times’ study found that there are currently more than 60 different gambling laws on the books in California. This makes it difficult for businesses to understand what is and is not allowed. In addition, law enforcement officials often give conflicting advice about which laws should be followed. This can lead to confusion and potential compliance violations.</p>
<p>Some business owners have even been charged with crimes for violating California’s complex gambling laws. These charges can be expensive to fight and can cause severe damage to a business’ reputation.</p>
<p>It is clear that California’s gambling laws need to be simplified. This would make it easier for businesses to operate legally and would help reduce the risk of criminal charges. Lawmakers should also consider creating a specific regulatory framework for gambling operations in California. This would provide clarity and certainty for businesses, and would help ensure that they are operating in compliance with the law.</p>
<h1 id="California’s-Gambling-Laws-Are-Hurting-the-Economy"><a href="#California’s-Gambling-Laws-Are-Hurting-the-Economy" class="headerlink" title="California’s Gambling Laws Are Hurting the Economy"></a>California’s Gambling Laws Are Hurting the Economy</h1><p>California’s gambling laws are outdated and need to be changed. The current laws are preventing the state from benefiting from the potential economic growth that could come from legalizing and regulating gambling.</p>
<p>The most obvious benefit of legalizing gambling is the revenue that would be generated for the state government. A study by the International Centre for Sport Security found that if gambling were legalized in California, it could generate up to $1.4 billion in tax revenue each year. This money could be used to fund important programs like education and transportation, or it could be used to reduce the state’s deficit.</p>
<p>Legalizing gambling would also create jobs for Californians. The casino industry is a major employer, and it would grow dramatically if gambling were legalized in California. Jobs in the casino industry include dealers, pit bosses, waitresses, and security personnel. In addition, businesses that provide services to casinos, such as restaurants, hotels, and transportation companies, would also see an increase in employment.</p>
<p>Legalizing gambling would also bring more tourists to California. People who visit casinos often like to visit other tourist destinations in the area too. This would generate revenue for California’s tourism industry and create jobs for people who work in the tourism industry.</p>
<p>Gambling is currently illegal in California except for charitable gaming and horse racing. This means that people who want to gamble have to go to other states or even other countries to do so. If California were to legalize gambling, it would become a destination for gamblers from all over the world. This would bring more money into the state and create jobs for people who work in the tourism industry.</p>
<p>The current laws prohibiting gambling in California are outdated and need to be changed. Legalizing gambling would generate revenue for the state government, create jobs, and bring more tourists to California. It’s time for California to join the rest of the country and legalize this popular pastime.</p>
<h1 id="California-Needs-to-Update-Its-Outdated-Gambling-Laws"><a href="#California-Needs-to-Update-Its-Outdated-Gambling-Laws" class="headerlink" title="California Needs to Update Its Outdated Gambling Laws"></a>California Needs to Update Its Outdated Gambling Laws</h1><p>The state of California has a number of laws regulating gambling that are in dire need of an update. These laws are outdated, inflexible, and do not reflect the current realities of the gambling industry.</p>
<p>One issue is how the state defines different types of gambling. For instance, California still classifies bingo as a type of gambling, while most other states have abandoned this classification. This distinction is particularly relevant given that California has a large population of seniors, many of whom play bingo regularly. Updating the law to recognize bingo as a game of skill would help protect these players from criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>Another issue is that California’s laws do not account for new forms of gambling that have emerged in recent years. For example, the state has no regulations governing internet poker or casino games played on mobile devices. This leaves players vulnerable to fraud and exploitation by unscrupulous operators.</p>
<p>Additionally, California’s laws are very rigid when it comes to gambling licenses. There are a limited number of licenses available, and they are granted only to pre-approved organizations. This system makes it difficult for new businesses to enter the market and gives existing businesses a monopoly on the market.</p>
<p>Finally, California’s gambling laws are woefully out of date when it comes to taxation. The state currently imposes a special tax on commercial casinos, but does not tax other forms of gambling such as online poker or lottery tickets. This discrepancy creates an unfair playing field and drives business away from regulated casinos to illegal offshore sites.</p>
<p>In order to address these issues, the state of California should update its gambling laws to reflect the realities of the modern gaming industry. This would involve recognizing new forms of gambling, making licensing more flexible, and adjusting taxation rates accordingly. By updating its laws in this way, California can create a safe and fair environment for gamblers while also encouraging legitimate businesses to operate in the state.</p>
<h1 id="It’s-Time-to-Legalize-Wagering-in-California"><a href="#It’s-Time-to-Legalize-Wagering-in-California" class="headerlink" title="It’s Time to Legalize Wagering in California"></a>It’s Time to Legalize Wagering in California</h1><p>California is the place where dreams come true. From the Golden State Warriors dynasty to Hollywood, some of the world’s most exciting and innovative things happen here. It’s only fitting that as California enters a new era in its history, it should legalize wagering.</p>
<p>Gambling has been around for centuries, with different forms popping up in different parts of the world at different times. But it wasn’t until the early 1800s that gambling began to be legalized in various parts of the world. The United States was one of the early adopters of legalized gambling, with Nevada leading the charge in 1931.</p>
<p>Today, gambling is a multi-billion dollar industry, with different forms of wagering available in many jurisdictions around the world. Wagering is big business, and it’s time for California to get in on the action.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to legalize wagering in California. First and foremost, it would provide much-needed revenue for the state. With a budget deficit of over $20 billion, legalized wagering could help bridge that gap. In addition, it would create jobs and support businesses throughout the state.</p>
<p>Legalized gambling would also be great for tourism. Visitors from all over would flock to California to enjoy our casinos and race tracks. This would generate significant revenue for local businesses and create thousands of jobs.</p>
<p>And finally, legalized gambling would be good for our economy overall. It would provide a new form of entertainment for Californians and generate tax revenue that could be used to fund important programs like education and infrastructure improvements.</p>
<p>It’s time for California to legalize wagering. We’re a forward-thinking state and we should embrace this new form of entertainment. Let’s make California the premiere destination for gambling in North America!</p>

But is this really the case?</p>
<p>In order to answer this question, we need to take a look at what free play actually is. Free play is basically when a casino offers you free money in order to gamble with. This can be an excellent way to try out a new casino, or to get some extra cash to play with.</p>
<p>However, not all casinos offer free play all of the time. In fact, the Hard Rock and Roll Casino in Atlantic City only sends out free play occasionally. So if you’re looking for a casino that’s always giving away free money, this may not be the one for you.</p>

<p> typically, the Atlantic City casinos send out comps (comps being short for complimentary gifts or services) in one of two ways: through mail or electronically. Hard Rock &amp; Roll Casino is no different, and generally sends out its comps electronically. This means that if you are a regular player at the casino, you will likely start receiving emails with special offers such as free play, complimentary rooms, and discounted rates on dining and other amenities.</p>
<p>So how often does Hard Rock &amp; Roll Casino in Atlantic City send out free play? The answer is – it depends. But generally speaking, if you are a regular player and you follow the casino’s promotions, you can expect to receive some form of free play offer every month or two.</p>

        <h1 id="Penn-National-Casino-Bans-Megaways-Game"><a href="#Penn-National-Casino-Bans-Megaways-Game" class="headerlink" title="Penn National Casino Bans Megaways Game"></a>Penn National Casino Bans Megaways Game</h1><p>Penn National Casino has announced that it will no longer offer games developed by Blueprint Gaming, specifically citing the company’s Megaways game as the reason. Megaways is a popular game mechanic that features an increasingly large number of paylines as the spin progresses.</p>
<p>Penn National expressed concerns that the volatility of Megaways games was too high and could lead to player dissatisfaction. A spokesperson for Blueprint Gaming responded by saying that the company is “disappointed” by Penn National’s decision and believes that the casino is unfairly targeting its products.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Penn National has taken issue with Megaways games; the casino also banned them in November of last year. However, other casinos in Pennsylvania still offer Megaways games, which suggests that there may be more to this story than simply volatility.</p>
<h1 id="Morgana-Megaways-Banned-by-Penn-National-Casino"><a href="#Morgana-Megaways-Banned-by-Penn-National-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Morgana Megaways Banned by Penn National Casino"></a>Morgana Megaways Banned by Penn National Casino</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Morgana Megaways, the new and upcoming slot game from Blueprint Gaming, was recently banned by the Penn National Casino. The casino decided that the game was too volatile and risky for their customers.</p>
<p>The slot game is a 6x4 reel slot game with up to 117,649 ways to win. This makes it one of the most volatility and risky games on the market. The casino has not released an official statement as to why they decided to ban the game, but it is speculated that they felt that the potential rewards were not worth the risk of losing money.</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming has yet to respond to the news. This is likely due to the fact that they are still in negotiations with other casinos about releasing Morgana Megaways. It is unclear whether or not the Penn National Casino ban will have an impact on these negotiations.</p>
<p>Morgana Megaways has been a huge hit since its release earlier this year. The game quickly became one of the most popular slots on the market. It features stunning graphics and an exciting gameplay that keeps players coming back for more.</p>
<h1 id="Penn-National-Casino-Blocks-Access-to-Morgana-Megaways"><a href="#Penn-National-Casino-Blocks-Access-to-Morgana-Megaways" class="headerlink" title="Penn National Casino Blocks Access to Morgana Megaways"></a>Penn National Casino Blocks Access to Morgana Megaways</h1><p>A spokesperson for Penn National Casino has announced that the casino will not be featuring the new Morgana Megaways slot game. Megaways slots are a relatively new type of slot game that offer players more ways to win thanks to an increased number of possible winning combinations.</p>
<p>Penn National Casino is the latest in a growing list of casinos to block access to the new game. The move comes as no surprise, as Penn National has a history of being opposed to new slot games. The casino’s slot portfolio is made up entirely of older games, most of which are several years old.</p>
<p>Morgana Megaways is one of the most popular new Megaways slots and has been a big hit with players since its release earlier this year. The game offers players up to 117,649 ways to win, making it one of the most exciting and potentially rewarding Megaways slots available.</p>
<p>The decision by Penn National Casino to block access to Morgana Megaways is likely to disappoint many players, especially those who live near or frequent the casino. However, there are still plenty of other casinos where players can enjoy this exciting new game.</p>
<h1 id="Morgana-Megaways-unavailable-at-Penn-National-Casino"><a href="#Morgana-Megaways-unavailable-at-Penn-National-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Morgana Megaways unavailable at Penn National Casino"></a>Morgana Megaways unavailable at Penn National Casino</h1><p>Slot enthusiasts were in for a disappointment when they logged on to play Morgana Megaways at Penn National Casino. The game was unavailable, causing some players to look for other options.</p>
<p>A representative from the casino said that the game was down for maintenance. However, there wasn’t any information about when it would be available again. This left some people frustrated, as they weren’t able to enjoy the game they came to the casino to play.</p>
<p>Others decided to try out different slots, such as Raging Rhino and Where’s the Gold. These games were also popular, but some people still missed Morgana Megaways.</p>
<p>It’s not clear when the game will be available again at Penn National Casino, but players are hoping it will be soon. In the meantime, they’ll just have to try out other slots and hope for the best.</p>
<h1 id="Penn-National-Casino-ends-partnership-with-game-provider-over-Morgana-Megaways"><a href="#Penn-National-Casino-ends-partnership-with-game-provider-over-Morgana-Megaways" class="headerlink" title="Penn National Casino ends partnership with game provider over Morgana Megaways."></a>Penn National Casino ends partnership with game provider over Morgana Megaways.</h1><p>Penn National Casino has announced that it is terminating its partnership with game provider Blueprint Gaming over the supplier’s use of the Morgana Megaways slot title.</p>
<p>In a statement, Penn National said that it had become concerned about the “potential for player confusion” between its own brand and the new Megaways game. The casino operator also cited “commercial sensitivity” as a factor in its decision to end the agreement.</p>
<p>Blueprint Gaming responded to Penn National’s announcement by stating that it was “disappointed” with the decision and that it planned to “actively pursue other opportunities within the US market.”</p>
<p>The Morgana Megaways slot is a spin-off of Blueprint’s popular Merlin’s Millions slot title. It features six reels and up to 117,649 ways to win. The game has been a hit with players since its launch earlier this year, and is currently ranked as the number two slots title on the UK Gambling Commission’s list of most popular games.</p>
<p>The termination of Penn National Casino’s agreement with Blueprint Gaming follows similar decisions by other operators in recent months. In March, both Paddy Power Betfair and William Hill announced that they were ending their relationships with Red Tiger Gaming over its use of the MegaWays mechanic.</p>

The owner, who has not been publicly identified, allegedly used the casino to launder money that was acquired through illegal activities.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the casino owner has been accused of illegal activity. In fact, he has a long history of legal troubles, including accusations of fraud and tax evasion. However, this is the first time that money laundering has been implicated.</p>
<p>The raid on the casino was conducted by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Officials from both agencies were tight-lipped about the details of the investigation, but they confirmed that it was ongoing.</p>
<p>The casino owner has not yet been charged with any crime, and he has refused to comment on the allegations. However, if he is found guilty of money laundering, he could face significant penalties, including jail time and fines.</p>
<h1 id="Billionaire-Casino-Owner-Accused-of-Fraud"><a href="#Billionaire-Casino-Owner-Accused-of-Fraud" class="headerlink" title="Billionaire Casino Owner Accused of Fraud"></a>Billionaire Casino Owner Accused of Fraud</h1><p>A billionaire casino owner has been accused of fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>The SEC alleges that the casino owner misused his position as a director of a public company to enrich himself and his family.</p>
<p>According to the SEC, the casino owner paid himself $11 million in undisclosed compensation, and also used company funds to make illegal contributions to political campaigns.</p>
<p>The casino owner has denied any wrongdoing, and said that he will fight the allegations.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the casino owner has been accused of fraud. In 2011, he was sued by investors who claimed that he had mislead them about the financial health of his casinos.</p>
<p>The casino owner settled that lawsuit for $75 million.</p>
<h1 id="Mayor-Firm-on-Plan-to-Strip-Casino-Owner-of-License"><a href="#Mayor-Firm-on-Plan-to-Strip-Casino-Owner-of-License" class="headerlink" title="Mayor Firm on Plan to Strip Casino Owner of License"></a>Mayor Firm on Plan to Strip Casino Owner of License</h1><p>The mayor of Atlantic City remains adamant that the city’s casino license should be revoked from the owner of the Revel casino, despite warnings from state officials that such a move could imperil the city’s finances.</p>
<p>Mayor Don Guardian reiterated his stance at a budget hearing on Monday, saying that he is still pushing for the revocation of Revel’s license, even if it means the city has to fend for itself.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to back down on this,” Guardian said. “It’s about doing what’s right for the city.”</p>
<p>State officials have warned that revoking Revel’s license could result in the loss of up to $25 million in revenue for Atlantic City. But Guardian dismissed those concerns, saying that the city would be better off without a casino that has been mired in financial troubles since it opened two years ago.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe for one minute that we’re going to miss an extra $25 million,” Guardian said. “We’re missing out on millions and millions of dollars now.”</p>
<p>Revel filed for bankruptcy protection last month, and its owners are currently in talks with state officials about a possible sale of the casino. But Mayor Guardian says he is not interested in any deal that would keep Revel open.</p>
<p>“My position has always been that Revel should not be in business,” Guardian said. “They’ve been a disaster for our economy.”</p>

Genting Group, a Malaysia-based conglomerate, announced earlier this year that it would be selling the casino. The announcement has sparked interest from a number of potential buyers, including Caesars Entertainment and an investment group led by Steve Wynn.</p>
<p>While Genting Group has not yet disclosed a price tag for the casino, analysts estimate that it could fetch as much as $4 billion. The sale is part of Genting Group’s effort to divest itself of non-core assets and focus on its core business operations in Asia.</p>
<p>Red Rock Casino is one of the most profitable casinos in Las Vegas, reporting more than $260 million in revenue last year. The casino is also one of the few properties in downtown Las Vegas that is not owned by Steve Wynn or Caesars Entertainment.</p>
<p>The sale of Red Rock Casino is expected to close by the end of this year.</p>

It is owned and operated by Station Casinos.</p>
<p>The property has a 122,000-square-foot (11,200 m2) casino,ed ayakkabı markaları 1,740 hotel rooms and suites, 30 villas, 14 restaurants and cafés, and a spa. In addition to the resort’s amenities, Red Rock offers convention and meeting space. The adjacent Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area provides opportunities for outdoor activities.</p>
<p>The casino was first proposed in 1999 by Station Casinos as the result of a joint venture with Hollywood Park Casino. Construction began in 2002 with an opening planned for early 2004. Delays led to the opening on March 1, 2005. The original owners were Station Casinos (78%), Tamares Group (14%), and American Nevada Company (8%). However, in February 2009, American Nevada sold its share to Tamares Group giving them a 92% ownership stake.</p>
<p>In January 2013, Red Rock agreed to be acquired by Gaming and Leisure Properties along with nine other casinos owned by Station Casinos for about $1.75 billion. In November 2014, GLP spun off its casino properties into a new company named Affinity Gaming. Affinity Gaming then sold Red Rock to Station Casinos for $365 million.</p>

One question that often comes up for new users is how to deposit their funds into the casino. In this article, we’ll provide a step-by-step guide on how to do just that.</p>
<p>To start off, you’ll need to create an account on the Stake Casino website. Once you have created your account, you’ll be given a unique deposit address. This address will be used to send your funds to the casino.</p>
<p>Now that you have your deposit address, it’s time to send some funds over! In order to do so, you’ll need a crypto wallet that supports either Bitcoin or Ethereum. If you don’t yet have a crypto wallet, we recommend using Coinbase as they are one of the most popular and user-friendly wallets around.</p>
<p>Once you have your wallet set-up, it’s time to send some funds over! In Coinbase, click on the “Send” tab and then select the currency you want to send (in this case, Bitcoin or Ethereum). Next, enter the deposit address from Stake Casino and enter the amount of funds you want to send. Finally, click on “Send Funds” and your funds will be on their way!</p>
<p>That’s all there is to it! It may seem daunting at first but depositing on Stake Casino is actually a very easy process. So don’t hesitate any longer and head on over to Stake Casino today to experience all that they have to offer!</p>

<p>Curie is a new digital asset that was released in March of 2019. It is a fork of the ERC-20 token called DAGCoin and can be stored in any Ethereum wallet. Curie is intended to be used as a payment method for goods and services and can also be used to gamble at online casinos.</p>
<p>The first step you need to take in order to use Curie at Stake Casino is to create an Ethereum wallet. You can do this by going to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/">https://www.myetherwallet.com/</a>. Once you have created your wallet, you will need to generate a public address and a private key. The public address is what you will give to others so they can send you Curie, and the private key is what you will use to access your funds. Be sure to keep your private key safe and secure, as anyone who has it will be able to withdraw your funds from your wallet.</p>
<p>Once you have created your Ethereum wallet, you will need to purchase some Curie tokens. The best way to do this is through an exchange such as Coinbase or Binance. Once you have purchased some tokens, you can transfer them to your Ethereum wallet by following the instructions on the exchange’s website.</p>
<p>Now that you have created an Ethereum wallet and purchased some Curie tokens, you are ready to deposit them at Stake Casino! In order to do this, simply navigate to the “Deposit” page on the casino’s website and select “Curie” as your deposit method. You will then be prompted to enter your public address and the amount of Curie that you would like to deposit. Once you have entered all of the information, click “Deposit” and your funds will be transferred immediately!</p>
<p>Congratulations, you have now successfully deposited funds into your Stake Casino account using Curie! Be sure to enjoy yourself while playing your favourite games!</p>

Booongo has the answer.2. Booongo Strikes again! They have Purchased Caesars Casino.3. Booongo Gaming buys Caesars Casino for an undisclosed amount</h1><ol>
<li><p>On July 2nd, 2018, it was announced that Booongo has purchased Caesars Casino for an undisclosed amount. This purchase is just another in a long line of buys by Booongo, who seem to be on a buying spree lately.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Caesars Casino is one of the largest and most well-known online casinos in the world. It’s no wonder then that Booongo jumped at the chance to buy it out. With this move they are cementing their position as one of the top providers of casino games in the industry.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In a statement released by Booongo, they said that they were excited to add Caesars Casino to their list of properties. They also promised that they would be investing heavily in order to make sure that Caesars Casino remains one of the top casinos in the world.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It will be interesting to see how Booongo’s takeover of Caesars Casino affects the industry as a whole. It is clear that Booongo is looking to become a major player in the market, and with moves like this, they are well on their way to doing so.</p>
</li>

<h1 id="4-Booongo-acquires-Caesars-casino-for-an-estimated-1-billion"><a href="#4-Booongo-acquires-Caesars-casino-for-an-estimated-1-billion" class="headerlink" title="4. Booongo acquires Caesars casino for an estimated $1 billion"></a>4. Booongo acquires Caesars casino for an estimated $1 billion</h1><p>Global casino software developer Booongo announced today that it has agreed to acquire Caesars casino for an estimated $1 billion. </p>
<p>This move will make Booongo the largest casino software developer in the world, with a market share of over 30%. The company is best known for its slots games, which are popular among players around the world. </p>
<p>Caesars casino is also a popular destination for players, with over 125 million registered users. The acquisition will give Booongo access to this large player base, as well as to Caesars’ extensive portfolio of casino games. </p>
<p>“We are very excited about this acquisition,” said Booongo CEO Igor Khmel. “Caesars casino is a premier brand in the industry, and we look forward to bringing our innovative slots games to their players.” </p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2019.</p>
<h1 id="5-Chinese-gaming-company-Booongo-purchases-Caesars-casino"><a href="#5-Chinese-gaming-company-Booongo-purchases-Caesars-casino" class="headerlink" title="5. Chinese gaming company Booongo purchases Caesars casino"></a>5. Chinese gaming company Booongo purchases Caesars casino</h1><p>Another Chinese gaming company has thrown its hat into the U.S. casino market.</p>
<p>Booongo, a leading developer and provider of online gaming software, announced that it has completed the purchase of Caesars Interactive Entertainment Inc. (“CIE”), a unit of Caesars Entertainment Corporation (“Caesars”), for $4.4 billion in cash. The acquisition makes Booongo one of the largest casino game companies in the world.</p>
<p>The move comes as Chinese gaming firms are seeking to expand outside of their home market, which is facing increasing regulation and competition. In addition to Booongo, fellow Chinese gaming companies such as Dalian Wanda Group and Alibaba Group have also made moves into the global casino market in recent years.</p>
<p>The acquisition will give Booongo access to CIE’s popular brands such as CAESARS, Bally’s, Harrah’s, and Horseshoe, as well as its massive customer base. Booongo plans to integrate CIE’s games into its own product offerings with the goal of expanding its reach into new markets.</p>
<p>For Caesars, the sale is part of its ongoing efforts to reduce its debt load. The company had been looking to sell CIE since last year and had received interest from a number of potential buyers.</p>
<p>The sale is still subject to regulatory approval, but is expected to close in the second quarter of this year.</p>

<p>The casino announced the change on Tuesday, along with other changes aimed at making the property more “family-friendly.”</p>
<p>Beginning on July 1st, all guests must be 21 or older to enter the casino floor and all areas of the property except the restaurants and bars. The casino will also stop admitting guests at 2 a.m.</p>
<p>In a statement, the casino said that it was making the changes in response to customer feedback.</p>
<p>“We have listened to our customers and are making these changes to create a more welcoming and family-friendly environment,” said Resorts World Casino President Brian J. Finnegan. “We look forward to continuing to provide our guests with world-class gaming and entertainment experiences.”</p>

The casino will reopen at 8 am the following Tuesday.</p>
<p>This weekend is one of the busiest weekends of the year for casinos, as many people take advantage of the three-day holiday to gamble. But Resorts World appears to be taking a different approach this year, choosing to close down early and give their employees some time off.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the casino said that this decision was made in light of the recent tragedy at the casino. On May 18th, a gunman opened fire in the casino, killing one person and wounding several others. The gunman later killed himself.</p>
<p>This horrific event has understandably left employees traumatized, and the casino is hoping that by giving them some time off, they will be able to recover and return to work ready to serve their customers.</p>
<p>Despite this closure, other casinos in the area are expected to be packed over the Memorial Day Weekend. Foxwoods Resort Casino is expecting an especially busy weekend, as it is hosting an outdoor concert by popular country artist Jason Aldean on Saturday night.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether or not the Resorts World Casino closure will impact its business in any significant way. But it is clear that the casino is trying to do what is best for its employees in light of a very difficult situation.</p>

<p>This change goes into effect starting Saturday, March 21st. The casino will also be open from 11am to 7pm on Sundays.</p>
