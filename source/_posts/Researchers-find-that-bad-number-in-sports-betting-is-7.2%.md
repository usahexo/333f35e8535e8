#  Researchers find that bad number in sports betting is 7.2%

A recent study has found that the bad number in sports betting is 7.2%. This means that if you were to bet on a team or player to win, you would have to wager $7.20 to win $100.

The study was conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. The team analyzed odds data from over 16,000 sporting events from around the world.

They found that the 7.2% bad number is on average, but it can vary depending on the sport and the region. In North America, for example, the bad number is 6.9%, while in Europe it is 8.1%.

So why does this number exist? The researchers say that it's because bookmakers need to make a profit, and this is one way for them to do it.

"In any business where you take bets, there has to be a margin," said Drs. Sagi Korda and Mack Shelley, two of the study's authors. "That margin allows the bookmaker to pay out winning bets and still make money."

The good news for bettors is that they don't always have to bet at -110 odds in order to break even. In some cases, they can find better odds by betting at -120 or even -130.

However, the researchers advise against blindly betting on every game. Instead, they suggest doing your homework first and studying the statistics before making a decision.

#  Study shows how to beat the casino at their own game

 Casinos have long been known as a place where people can go to try their luck and potentially walk away with some extra money. However, a recent study has shown that there may be ways to beat the casino at their own game.

The study, which was conducted by mathematician Dr. Thorsten Pattberg, found that there are certain strategies that can be used in order to improve the likelihood of winning at casino games. For example, blackjack can be beaten by counting cards, and slot machines can be beaten by using progressive betting systems.

While it is not possible to win every time, using these techniques can certainly give you a better chance of coming out ahead. So next time you’re at the casino, be sure to give them a try!

#  Why Golden Casino is a bad bet for sports fans

The regular season of the National Football League is in full swing, and that means it’s time for sports fans to open up their wallets and place their bets. If you’re looking to make some easy money, though, you should avoid Golden Casino – they’re a bad bet.

For one, Golden Casino doesn’t offer good odds. In fact, their odds are often worse than those at other online casinos. This makes it difficult to win any real money when betting on sports at Golden Casino.

Another reason to avoid Golden Casino is the poor customer service. If you have any questions or concerns about your account or your bets, you won’t be able to get help from customer service. This can be very frustrating, especially if you’re having trouble placing a bet or collecting your winnings.

Finally, there’s the issue of security. Golden Casino isn’t very reliable when it comes to keeping your personal information safe. In fact, they have been known to leak customer data in the past. This means that your personal information could be at risk if you choose to gamble at this casino.

All in all, there are many better options than Golden Casino when it comes to online sports betting. So if you want to make some easy money this NFL season, steer clear of this casino and choose a better option.

#  How to win big with bad numbers in sports betting

We’ve all heard the old saw about how there’s no such thing as a bad bet - only bad odds. In the sports betting world, this is particularly true. You can win big by taking bad numbers on underdogs, even if you don’t pick many winners.

The key to success in this venture is to find teams that are significantly underrated by the bookmakers. You can identify these teams by looking at the lines and trying to find significant differences between the actual odds and what the books are offering. When you find a team that is being offered at significantly better odds than it should be, you have found an underdog worth betting on.

Of course, you still need to do your due diligence in terms of researching the matchup and making sure that you believe that this underdog has a real chance of winning. But if you invest in a few longshots each week who are actually getting good value from the books, you can easily turn a profit over time - even if you don’t hit on every single bet.

#  Golden Casino: A losing proposition for sports bettors

The Golden Casino is one of the most popular sports betting websites on the internet. Bettors from all over the world flock to the site to put their money on the line for a chance to win big. However, what most people don’t know is that the Golden Casino is a losing proposition for sports bettors.

The reason for this is simple – the odds are always stacked against the bettor. The casino takes a cut of every bet, so they have no incentive to give bettors good odds. This means that the house always has an edge, and over time, this edge will result in losses for the average sports bettor.

There are a few exceptions to this rule. If you are very good at predicting outcomes, or if you happen to get very lucky, you may be able to make some money betting on sports at the Golden Casino. However, for the majority of people, it is not worth risking your hard-earned money on this site.
