#  Bingo Bahamas is a Shade of Blue

The clear blue waters of the Bahamas are a favorite vacation spot for many, and for good reason. The sparkling turquoise ocean and soft white sand beaches make for an idyllic setting. But have you ever stopped to think what makes the water so blue?

Most people would say that it's the sunlight reflecting off the waves, but that's not actually the case. The ocean is blue because of the reflection of the sky. The higher in the sky the clouds are, the bluer the ocean appears. This is because the shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, are scattered more by tiny particles in the atmosphere than longer wavelengths like red and yellow.

So next time you're lounging on a beach in the Bahamas, remember that you're enjoying a beautiful shade of blue!

#  What Color is Bingo Bahamas?

The colors of Bingo Bahamas are blue and yellow. The blue is a bright, sky blue and the yellow is a deep, golden color. The colors work well together and create a fun and happy feeling for the game.

The blue represents the ocean and sky, both of which are integral parts of the Bahamian landscape. The blue is also symbolic of the clear, bright skies that are so common in the Bahamas. The yellow is inspired by the sun, which provides warm light and beautiful colors to the islands. Together, the colors evoke a sense of relaxation and joy that is perfect for playing Bingo.

The blue and yellow also work well as branding colors. They are immediately recognizable as Bahamian and will make people feel good when they see them. This is important for a game that is supposed to be fun and upbeat.

#  Bahamas National Lottery Announces New Blue Bingo Game

The Bahamas National Lottery (BONL) is excited to announce the launch of its new Blue Bingo game. Players will have the chance to win exciting cash prizes and other great rewards, including a brand new Ford Focus car!

To participate in Blue Bingo, players must purchase a Blue Bingo card from any authorised BONL retailer. Cards are priced at $10 each and contain 30 numbers. Players then mark off the numbers as they are called during the game.

There are five different prize levels in Blue Bingo, with prizes available for matching one, two, three, four or all five of the numbers called. The first prize level, for matching one number, pays out $100, while the top prize for matching all five numbers is $10,000.

In addition to cash prizes, Blue Bingo players also have a chance to win one of five Ford Focus cars. The cars are awarded as follows: one car goes to the player with the first valid winning ticket in the game; one car goes to the player with the second valid winning ticket; and three cars go to players who have purchased a “Star” card. A “Star” card costs an additional $5 and gives players an extra chance to win one of the three cars.

Blue Bingo is being launched just in time for the holiday season and is sure to be a popular game with players of all ages. So why not head down to your nearest BONL retailer today and get your hands on a Blue Bingo card? Good luck!
