The Princess Hotel and Casino does not have a hotel on site, but there are many hotels within walking distance. The cheapest hotel near the casino is the Martha’s Inn, which has rooms starting at just $25 per night.

#  How to Play Blackjack in Belize - Tips for a Single Deck Game

There are a few things to consider when playing blackjack in Belize. The first is that the game is typically played with only one deck of cards, so the odds are a bit different than in games where more than one deck is used. This also means that there is a greater chance of getting blackjack (a hand of 21) when you bet on it.

The second thing to consider when playing blackjack in Belize is the fact that the dealer must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more. This increases the chances that the dealer will bust (go over 21), giving players an advantage.

Third, players are allowed to split pairs (two cards of the same rank) up to three times, which gives them more opportunities to win money. Lastly, players can claim insurance against losing their bet to the dealer if they feel that their hand isn't strong enough to beat the dealer's.

So, those are some things to keep in mind when playing blackjack in Belize. Remember that it's important to make smart decisions and stay within your budget; it's easy to get carried away when playing this popular casino game!
