#   How to deposit in Stake Casino Curie - A beginner's guide

This guide is for those who are looking to start playing at Stake Casino and would like to deposit using the cryptocurrency called Curie.

Curie is a new digital asset that was released in March of 2019. It is a fork of the ERC-20 token called DAGCoin and can be stored in any Ethereum wallet. Curie is intended to be used as a payment method for goods and services and can also be used to gamble at online casinos.

The first step you need to take in order to use Curie at Stake Casino is to create an Ethereum wallet. You can do this by going to https://www.myetherwallet.com/. Once you have created your wallet, you will need to generate a public address and a private key. The public address is what you will give to others so they can send you Curie, and the private key is what you will use to access your funds. Be sure to keep your private key safe and secure, as anyone who has it will be able to withdraw your funds from your wallet.

Once you have created your Ethereum wallet, you will need to purchase some Curie tokens. The best way to do this is through an exchange such as Coinbase or Binance. Once you have purchased some tokens, you can transfer them to your Ethereum wallet by following the instructions on the exchange's website.

Now that you have created an Ethereum wallet and purchased some Curie tokens, you are ready to deposit them at Stake Casino! In order to do this, simply navigate to the "Deposit" page on the casino's website and select "Curie" as your deposit method. You will then be prompted to enter your public address and the amount of Curie that you would like to deposit. Once you have entered all of the information, click "Deposit" and your funds will be transferred immediately!

Congratulations, you have now successfully deposited funds into your Stake Casino account using Curie! Be sure to enjoy yourself while playing your favourite games!
