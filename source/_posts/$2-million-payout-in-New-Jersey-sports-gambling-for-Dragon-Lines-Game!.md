$2 million in payouts were won by three NJ residents playing the Scientific Games' "Dragon Lines" slot game at the Borgata Casino in Atlantic City. The lucky players, who have chosen to remain anonymous, hit the $2 million jackpot on Tuesday, November 14th.

"Dragon Lines," an Asian-themed slot game, offers a progressive jackpot that builds with each spin of the reels. The game is linked to other machines at casinos nationwide, resulting in one gigantic payout.

This isn't the first time a big payout has been won on this game; just last year, a lucky player from Ohio hit the $3 million jackpot on the same slot machine.

The Dragon Lines game is a horse racing simulation, where players can bet on horses to win, place or show. The bettor who hit the $1 million jackpot reportedly put down just $5 on the winning horse.

This latest big payout underscores the excitement and potential profits that can be made in sports gambling in New Jersey. With more and more games being added to the market all the time, there are plenty of opportunities for gamers to strike it big.

#  Third major payout in a week from NJ sports gambling, with $1.5 million won on Dragon Lines game!

It was another headline-grabbing day for online sports gambling in New Jersey, as another lucky player scooped a major payout. This time it was a $1.5 million win on the Dragon Lines game at Betfair Casino.

It’s the third big win in a week for NJ players, following payouts of $1 million and $2.4 million earlier in the week. The streak has helped to cement New Jersey’s position as one of the most successful states for online sports gambling.

The Dragon Lines game is a five-reel slot with 20 paylines, and it proved to be a winning formula for one lucky player on Wednesday. The win means that the player has now pocketed over $3.9 million in payouts from Betfair Casino since starting to play there in February.

The growing popularity of online sports betting in New Jersey is helping to drive up overall revenue for the industry. Figures from the latest report from the Division of Gaming Enforcement show that online gambling brought in over $224 million in revenue in 2018, up by over 25% on the previous year.

That growth looks likely to continue in 2019, with new gaming products being launched this year including live dealer games and a new sportsbook from DraftKings. Online gambling is now firmly established as one of the main drivers of revenue for Atlantic City casinos, and looks set to continue growing in popularity.

#  Huge payouts continue in NJ sports gambling, this time with a $3 million win on Dragon Lines casino game!

Only a few weeks after a Monmouth County man hit it big on sports betting, another New Jersey resident is celebrating a major win. This time it was on the Dragon Lines casino game at DraftKings, where the player took home $3 million.

The win is just the latest in a series of big payouts happening in New Jersey's nascent sports gambling industry. In early March, a Monmouth County man won nearly $1 million on a bet placed on the Philadelphia Eagles to win the Super Bowl.

Gambling industry analysts say that the wins are not surprising, given the high payouts available on many sports bets. The average payout for a winning bet on the Super Bowl was $381,932 this year, according to figures from VegasInsider.com. That's more than 10 times what someone would have won by betting on the favorite, the New England Patriots.

For players looking to score big payouts, NJ sports gambling offers plenty of opportunities. In addition to DraftKings, which is one of the largest online sportsbooks in the country, there are numerous other operators now offering their services in New Jersey including Caesars Entertainment, FanDuel, and William Hill US.

As interest in NJ sports gambling continues to grow, so too does the potential for big payouts. With major events like the NCAA March Madness basketball tournament and this year's World Cup coming up, there will be plenty of opportunities for players to make some serious money.
