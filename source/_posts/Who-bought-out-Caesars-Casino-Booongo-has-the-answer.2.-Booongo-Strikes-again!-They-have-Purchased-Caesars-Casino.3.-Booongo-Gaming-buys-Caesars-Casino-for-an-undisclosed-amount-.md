#  Who bought out Caesars Casino? Booongo has the answer.2. Booongo Strikes again! They have Purchased Caesars Casino.3. Booongo Gaming buys Caesars Casino for an undisclosed amount 

1. On July 2nd, 2018, it was announced that Booongo has purchased Caesars Casino for an undisclosed amount. This purchase is just another in a long line of buys by Booongo, who seem to be on a buying spree lately.

2. Caesars Casino is one of the largest and most well-known online casinos in the world. It’s no wonder then that Booongo jumped at the chance to buy it out. With this move they are cementing their position as one of the top providers of casino games in the industry.

3. In a statement released by Booongo, they said that they were excited to add Caesars Casino to their list of properties. They also promised that they would be investing heavily in order to make sure that Caesars Casino remains one of the top casinos in the world.

4. It will be interesting to see how Booongo’s takeover of Caesars Casino affects the industry as a whole. It is clear that Booongo is looking to become a major player in the market, and with moves like this, they are well on their way to doing so.

# 4. Booongo acquires Caesars casino for an estimated $1 billion 

Global casino software developer Booongo announced today that it has agreed to acquire Caesars casino for an estimated $1 billion. 

This move will make Booongo the largest casino software developer in the world, with a market share of over 30%. The company is best known for its slots games, which are popular among players around the world. 

Caesars casino is also a popular destination for players, with over 125 million registered users. The acquisition will give Booongo access to this large player base, as well as to Caesars' extensive portfolio of casino games. 

"We are very excited about this acquisition," said Booongo CEO Igor Khmel. "Caesars casino is a premier brand in the industry, and we look forward to bringing our innovative slots games to their players." 

The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2019.

# 5. Chinese gaming company Booongo purchases Caesars casino

Another Chinese gaming company has thrown its hat into the U.S. casino market.

Booongo, a leading developer and provider of online gaming software, announced that it has completed the purchase of Caesars Interactive Entertainment Inc. (“CIE”), a unit of Caesars Entertainment Corporation (“Caesars”), for $4.4 billion in cash. The acquisition makes Booongo one of the largest casino game companies in the world.

The move comes as Chinese gaming firms are seeking to expand outside of their home market, which is facing increasing regulation and competition. In addition to Booongo, fellow Chinese gaming companies such as Dalian Wanda Group and Alibaba Group have also made moves into the global casino market in recent years.

The acquisition will give Booongo access to CIE’s popular brands such as CAESARS, Bally’s, Harrah’s, and Horseshoe, as well as its massive customer base. Booongo plans to integrate CIE’s games into its own product offerings with the goal of expanding its reach into new markets.

For Caesars, the sale is part of its ongoing efforts to reduce its debt load. The company had been looking to sell CIE since last year and had received interest from a number of potential buyers.

The sale is still subject to regulatory approval, but is expected to close in the second quarter of this year.
