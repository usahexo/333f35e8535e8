#  Pro gamer apologizes for promoting gambling websites

In a recent interview with a popular gaming website, pro gamer Saahil "UNiVeRsE" Arora has apologized for promoting gambling websites in the past.

UNiVeRsE was one of the first high-profile gamers to be caught up in controversy for promoting gambling websites. In a now-deleted tweet from early 2016, he urged his followers to check out a betting site that he was affiliated with.

The uproar that followed led to UNiVeRsE deleting the tweet and apologizing to his fans. However, the damage had already been done, and many in the gaming community felt that he had betrayed their trust.

Now, almost 2 years later, UNiVeRsE has taken to social media to apologize once again. In a video posted on Twitter, he said:

"I want to apologize to my fans and the community for promoting those websites back in 2016. I made a mistake and I regret it."

He went on to say that he had learned from his mistake and would never promote such sites again.

Despite his apology, some members of the community are still angry at UNiVeRsE for promoting gambling in the past. However, most seem willing to forgive him and move on.

#  Tmartn fined $5,000 for violating Minnesota gambling laws

Tmartn, a prominent YouTuber and owner of the Team EnVyUs gaming organization, has been fined $5,000 by the state of Minnesota for violating gambling laws.

The violation occurred in March of this year, when Tmartn and his business partner Trevor "TmarTn" Martin hosted an online poker tournament that allowed players to bet money on the outcome. The event was not authorized by the state and therefore constituted a gambling violation.

Both Tmartn and TmarTn have issued statements apologizing for their actions and stating that they did not intend to break the law. They have also announced that they will be donating $5,000 to charity as restitution.

This is not the first time that Tmartn has been involved in a legal controversy. In September of last year he was sued by two plaintiffs who alleged that he had defrauded them out of money through a fraudulent investment scheme. The case is still pending.

#  Tmartn agrees to donate $30,000 to charity over gambling site promotion

 popular YouTuber and live streamer Trevor "Tmartn" Martin has come forward to admit wrongdoing in his promotion of a gambling site to his viewers and has agreed to donate $30,000 to charity.

Martin's admission came after a months-long investigation by the news outlet Kotaku, which published an article on Tuesday claiming that Martin and his business partner Tom "ProSyndicate" Cassell had undisclosed ownership stakes in the CS:GO Lotto website they promoted to their millions of subscribers.

The article alleged that the two profited from their involvement in the site, which allowed players to gamble real-world money on skins—customizable appearances for weapons in the game—for potentially large payouts.

In a video posted Wednesday, Martin addressed the allegations directly, saying he and Cassell made a "terrible mistake."

"We were unaware of the implications it could have and didn't take into consideration how our actions could impact others," Martin said. "For that I am sorry."



Martin went on to say that he and Cassell would be giving away their entire profits from CS:GO Lotto—an estimated $100,000—to three charities: The Trevor Project, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and Code For America. He also pledged to donate $30,000 more out of his own pocket.

#  Minnesota issues warning against unlicensed online gambling sites

Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson is warning state residents about the dangers of unlicensed online gambling sites. In a recent press release, Swanson urged Minnesotans to be vigilant against these sites, which may not offer fair and secure gaming experiences.

"Unlicensed gambling sites can be dangerous and may not protect your personal information," Swanson said. "I encourage Minnesotans to be careful when gambling online and to only use licensed sites that have been approved by the state."

Swanson also warned that unlicensed sites may not payout winnings, and could even steal gamers' identities or financial information.

Minnesota has several licensed online gambling sites, including TwinSpires.com (a subsidiary of Churchill Downs), JackpotCity Casino, and BigFishGames. These sites are safe and secure, and adhere to the highest industry standards for player protection.

#  Tmartn temporarily banned from streaming after promoting gambling sites

Tom "Tmartn" Cassell, one of the most popular YouTubers in the world, has been temporarily banned from streaming by Twitch after he was caught promoting gambling websites without disclosing that he owns one.

The 23-year-old came under fire earlier this week when it was revealed that he had been promoting the CSGO Lotto website - a site which allows users to gamble with real-world money on skin betting.

A video uploaded by Tmartn in March 2016 shows him and fellow YouTuber ProSyndicate - who has also been banned from Twitch - discussing how they won $13,000 worth of skins in just a few minutes by using the site.

Both Tmartn and ProSyndicate have since claimed that they didn't know that CSGO Lotto was a gambling site at the time of filming, and Tmartn has even gone as far as to call the whole debacle a "mistake".

However, Twitch doesn't seem to be buying their story, and the website has now issued a statement confirming that both Tmartn and ProSyndicate have been banned from streaming for 90 days.

"Twitch has indefinitely suspended casseltron and Prosyndicate from broadcasting due to multiple violations of our terms of service," the statement reads. "This includes but is not limited to intentionally deceiving our community by pretending to not have financial interests in the sites he promotes."

The news comes as a huge blow to Tmartn, who has over 9 million subscribers on YouTube and is thought to make millions of dollars each year through his various online ventures.
