The casino announced the change on Tuesday, along with other changes aimed at making the property more "family-friendly."

Beginning on July 1st, all guests must be 21 or older to enter the casino floor and all areas of the property except the restaurants and bars. The casino will also stop admitting guests at 2 a.m.

In a statement, the casino said that it was making the changes in response to customer feedback.

#  Resorts World Casino Closes Early for Memorial Day Weekend


The Resorts World Casino will be closing its doors at 6 pm on Friday, May 25th in observance of Memorial Day Weekend. The casino will reopen at 8 am the following Tuesday.

This weekend is one of the busiest weekends of the year for casinos, as many people take advantage of the three-day holiday to gamble. But Resorts World appears to be taking a different approach this year, choosing to close down early and give their employees some time off.

A spokeswoman for the casino said that this decision was made in light of the recent tragedy at the casino. On May 18th, a gunman opened fire in the casino, killing one person and wounding several others. The gunman later killed himself.

This horrific event has understandably left employees traumatized, and the casino is hoping that by giving them some time off, they will be able to recover and return to work ready to serve their customers.

Despite this closure, other casinos in the area are expected to be packed over the Memorial Day Weekend. Foxwoods Resort Casino is expecting an especially busy weekend, as it is hosting an outdoor concert by popular country artist Jason Aldean on Saturday night.

It remains to be seen whether or not the Resorts World Casino closure will impact its business in any significant way. But it is clear that the casino is trying to do what is best for its employees in light of a very difficult situation.

#  Resorts World Casino Closing Time Extended This Weekend




Resorts World Casino's closing time this weekend was unexpectedly extended by an hour. The casino usually closes at 4am, but will now close at 5am. A Resorts World spokesperson said that the change is due to "unexpected circumstances." Sources say that the casino is dealing with a high volume of visitors.

#  Resorts World Casino Closing Time Extended to Midnight

According to an announcement by the New York State Gaming Commission, Resorts World Casino will now be open until midnight. This extension is in response to the concerns of casino employees and patrons regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their daily lives.

This change goes into effect starting Saturday, March 21st. The casino will also be open from 11am to 7pm on Sundays.
