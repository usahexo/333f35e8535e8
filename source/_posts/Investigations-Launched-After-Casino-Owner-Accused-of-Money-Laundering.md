#  Investigations Launched After Casino Owner Accused of Money Laundering

Las Vegas, NV -- The owner of a popular casino in Las Vegas is under suspicion of money laundering after federal authorities conducted a raid on the property. The owner, who has not been publicly identified, allegedly used the casino to launder money that was acquired through illegal activities.

This is not the first time that the casino owner has been accused of illegal activity. In fact, he has a long history of legal troubles, including accusations of fraud and tax evasion. However, this is the first time that money laundering has been implicated.

The raid on the casino was conducted by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Officials from both agencies were tight-lipped about the details of the investigation, but they confirmed that it was ongoing.

The casino owner has not yet been charged with any crime, and he has refused to comment on the allegations. However, if he is found guilty of money laundering, he could face significant penalties, including jail time and fines.

#  Billionaire Casino Owner Accused of Fraud

A billionaire casino owner has been accused of fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The SEC alleges that the casino owner misused his position as a director of a public company to enrich himself and his family.

According to the SEC, the casino owner paid himself $11 million in undisclosed compensation, and also used company funds to make illegal contributions to political campaigns.

The casino owner has denied any wrongdoing, and said that he will fight the allegations.

This is not the first time that the casino owner has been accused of fraud. In 2011, he was sued by investors who claimed that he had mislead them about the financial health of his casinos.

The casino owner settled that lawsuit for $75 million.

#  Mayor Firm on Plan to Strip Casino Owner of License

The mayor of Atlantic City remains adamant that the city's casino license should be revoked from the owner of the Revel casino, despite warnings from state officials that such a move could imperil the city's finances.

Mayor Don Guardian reiterated his stance at a budget hearing on Monday, saying that he is still pushing for the revocation of Revel's license, even if it means the city has to fend for itself.

"I'm not going to back down on this," Guardian said. "It's about doing what's right for the city."

State officials have warned that revoking Revel's license could result in the loss of up to $25 million in revenue for Atlantic City. But Guardian dismissed those concerns, saying that the city would be better off without a casino that has been mired in financial troubles since it opened two years ago.

"I don't believe for one minute that we're going to miss an extra $25 million," Guardian said. "We're missing out on millions and millions of dollars now."

Revel filed for bankruptcy protection last month, and its owners are currently in talks with state officials about a possible sale of the casino. But Mayor Guardian says he is not interested in any deal that would keep Revel open.

"My position has always been that Revel should not be in business," Guardian said. "They've been a disaster for our economy."

#  Ownership of Red Rock Casino Remains in Question

The future of the Red Rock Casino in downtown Las Vegas remains uncertain, as its ownership is still up for grabs. Genting Group, a Malaysia-based conglomerate, announced earlier this year that it would be selling the casino. The announcement has sparked interest from a number of potential buyers, including Caesars Entertainment and an investment group led by Steve Wynn.

While Genting Group has not yet disclosed a price tag for the casino, analysts estimate that it could fetch as much as $4 billion. The sale is part of Genting Group's effort to divest itself of non-core assets and focus on its core business operations in Asia.

Red Rock Casino is one of the most profitable casinos in Las Vegas, reporting more than $260 million in revenue last year. The casino is also one of the few properties in downtown Las Vegas that is not owned by Steve Wynn or Caesars Entertainment.

The sale of Red Rock Casino is expected to close by the end of this year.
