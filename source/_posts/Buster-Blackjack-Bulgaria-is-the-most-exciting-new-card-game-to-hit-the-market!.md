## How to Play
Buster Blackjack Bulgaria is a variation of blackjack that is played with two decks of cards. The game can be played by up to four players, but is best suited for two. The object of the game is to score 21 points or to have a higher score than the dealer without going over 21.

Players will each be dealt two cards face up. The dealer will also deal two cards face up, one card face down. The face down card is called the ‘hole card’. Players will then make their bets. After everyone has placed their bets, the player with the highest hand (or who has not busted) will start the bidding. The player will either hit (take another card), stand (stick with what they have), double down (double their bet and get one more card), or split (split a hand into two hands).

The game progresses as follows: If the player busts, they lose regardless of what the dealer does; if the player doesn’t bust and the dealer busts, then the player wins; and if both players have the same score, it is a draw. After all players have had their turn, the dealer reveals their hole card and completes their hand. If the dealer’s total falls between 17 and 21, they must hit; if their total is 16 or below, they must stand.

If you're looking for a new and exciting card game to play, look no further than Tsipouro. This Bulgarian card game is perfect for players of all ages and skill levels. Tsipouro is a game of strategy and chance that will keep you entertained for hours on end.

The goal of the game is to collect as many cards as possible by taking tricks. The player who collects the most cards at the end of the game wins. Tsipouro can be played with two or more players, and the rules are easy to learn.

To begin, each player is dealt six cards. The player who was last to deal begins the game and play passes clockwise. The player who is left of the dealer starts the turn by playing one card from their hand. The next player then plays two cards, and so on until all players have played their cards.

The highest card in the suit played first takes the trick. If there is a tie, the highest trump card wins the trick. The winner of the trick collects all of the cards and sets them aside. Play then continues to the next player who must play a card from their hand.

When a player has no cards left in their hand, they must pick up four cards from the stockpile. The next time they take a turn, they must play three cards instead of one. When there are no more cards in the stockpile, play continues as normal with each player playing one card at a time.

The winner is the first player to run out of cards or the player with the most cards when there are no more cards left to be played.

#  Discover what all the excitement is about with this new Bulgarian card game!

Are you looking for a new card game to play? Then you should check out Bulgarian! This exciting game is quickly gaining in popularity, and for good reason – it’s a lot of fun!

Here’s how the game works. There are two teams, red and blue, and each team has 10 cards. The goal of the game is to discard all of your cards. To do this, you will need to make matches of either three or four cards of the same rank. When you have made a match, you can either place the card on the table in front of you or discard it into the pile in the middle.

If you are able to make a match of four cards, you can choose to go out instead of placing the fourth card on the table. This is a very advantageous position, as it means that your opponent must now take four cards from the deck instead of just one.

The first player to discard all their cards wins the game! So why not give Bulgarian a try? You may find yourself becoming just as addicted to it as everyone else seems to be!
