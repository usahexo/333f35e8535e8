#  Why was General Pershing called Blackjack Thackeray?

In 1919, General John J. Pershing was given the nickname of "Blackjack" by British Prime Minister Lloyd George and First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill. The two gave him this nickname after watching him play blackjack during a visit to America.

While in America, Pershing was also given the nickname of "Thackeray" by the press due to his talent at playing poker. It was said that he always seemed to get a blackjack (a two card hand totaling 21) and that he was as sharp as a Thackeray blade (a type of knife).

Despite being called Blackjack and Thackeray, Pershing was actually quite popular with the British people. After World War I ended, he was even made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath by King George V.

#  Did General Pershing have a gambling problem?

There is no definitive answer to this question, as it is difficult to ascertain the extent of General Pershing's gambling habit - if he had one at all. What is known, however, is that he was known to enjoy a game of poker, and that he did occasionally bet on horse races.

Some reports suggest that General Pershing may have been a compulsive gambler, and that his gambling addiction caused him considerable personal and financial problems. It has even been claimed that he once lost the equivalent of $2 million in a single day's gambling. However, there is no concrete evidence to support these claims, and it is possible that they are nothing more than hearsay.

What we do know for certain is that General Pershing was not immune to the temptation of gambling, and that it potentially posed a risk to both his personal and professional life. Nevertheless, it is impossible to say for certain whether or not his gambling habit ever got out of control.

#  What was the real story behind General Pershing and Blackjack Thackeray?

In 1918, General Pershing was the leader of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in Europe. In October of that year, he sent an urgent cable to the War Department in Washington, D.C., asking for authority to court-martial Blackjack Thackeray, an AEF officer who had been accused of misconduct.

Why was General Pershing so determined to discipline Thackeray? The answer can be found in a little-known episode that took place a few months earlier, in August 1918.

Thackeray was the leader of a unit of black soldiers known as the 92nd Division. In early August, his unit was stationed near Saint-Mihiel, in eastern France. On August 9, Thackeray and some of his men came across a group of Germans who were taking a break from their work.

Thackeray and his men ordered the Germans to surrender, but they refused. A firefight broke out, and Thackeray and six of his men were killed.

The army conducted an investigation into the incident and concluded that Thackeray had acted recklessly and disobeyed orders. As a result, General Pershing decided to court-martial him.

There was considerable criticism of Pershing's decision in the press and among members of Congress. Some people argued that Thackeray had been driven into a corner by the Germans and had no choice but to fight back. Others claimed that he had been singled out simply because he was black.

In the end, however, Pershing carried out his decision and Thackeray was found guilty of disobeying orders and reckless conduct. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment.

#  What was the relationship between General Pershing and Blackjack Thackeray?

There is much debate surrounding the relationship between General of the Armies John Joseph Pershing and Blackjack Thackeray. Some say that they were close friends, while others maintain that their interactions were limited and professional. In order to evaluate the extent of their relationship, it is important to first understand each individual’s biography.

John Joseph Pershing was born in September of 1860 in Laclede, Missouri. After graduating from West Point, he embarked on a distinguished military career that spanned over forty years. He played a significant role in several major wars, including World War I, where he led American forces on the Western Front.

Blackjack Thackeray was born in 1884 in Fort Worth, Texas. He followed in his father’s footsteps and became a mercenary soldier early on in his life. Over the course of his career, he fought in various wars across Africa and Europe. He eventually joined up with the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) during World War I and attained the rank of Brigadier General.

The two men met for the first time in France in 1917. Pershing was impressed by Thackeray’s military prowess and appointed him as commander of the African American 92nd Division-an all black regiment. The two men worked closely together throughout the war, and Thackeray was even present at Pershing’s side when he accepted the surrender of Imperial Germany in November 1918.

After World War I, Pershing stayed on in Europe as the head of the newly created American occupation force. Thackeray returned to America but kept in touch with his old friend via mail. In 1920, Pershing visited Thackeray while he was on a speaking tour in Los Angeles and they had dinner together at Philo Taylor Farnsworth’s home.

The two men’s relationship cooled somewhat after that meeting. It is unclear why this happened, but some have speculated that it had something to do with Thackeray’s decision to become involved with prohibition-era bootlegging operations in Texas. Whatever the reason may have been, their correspondence eventually ceased altogether and they never saw each other again before both men died-Pershing in 1948 and Thackeray in 1954.

While there is no definitive answer as to what kind of relationship John Joseph Pershing and Blackjack Thackeray had, it seems clear that they were at least acquaintances who respected each other professionally. They maintained a warm correspondence throughout World War I and were even photographed together on a number of occasions. However, their friendship cooled after 1920 for unknown reasons
