#  What are customary payout percentages in blackjack? 

When playing blackjack in a casino, you will likely be offered the opportunity to participate in a side bet known as insurance. This bet is designed to protect you against the possibility of the dealer having a blackjack. If the dealer has a blackjack, then your insurance bet will pay out at 2 to 1. However, if the dealer does not have a blackjack, then your insurance bet will lose. 

Most casinos require that players make an even money bet as their main bet before being allowed to make an insurance bet. This means that if you were to make an insurance bet and the dealer did have a blackjack, your main bet would also lose. 

The customary payout percentage for insurance bets is 17%. This means that for every $100 that you wager on insurance, you can expect to receive back $17 if the dealer does have a blackjack. 

If you are playing in a casino that offers reduced payout percentages for blackjacks (usually 6 or 7%), then you can expect your payout percentage for insurance bets to be lower as well.

#  What are customary payout percentages for a roulette table? 

When it comes to playing roulette, one of the most important things to understand is the payout percentage for each table. In short, this is the percentage of each bet that goes back to players in winnings. For example, a table with a payout percentage of 95% would return $95 in winnings for every $100 wagered. 

While there's no one definitive answer to this question, most casinos offer payout percentages somewhere between 89% and 98%. So, before you choose a table to play at, be sure to check the payout percentage to make sure you're getting the best return on your bets.

#  What are customary payout percentages in poker? 

There is no one definitive answer to this question as poker payout percentages can vary greatly depending on the type of game being played, the stakes involved, and the specific players involved. However, there are some general payout percentages that can be used as a guideline when playing poker. 

In general, most poker games have a payout schedule that awards players who finish in the money a percentage of the total pot size. For example, in a typical nine-player no limit Texas Hold 'em game where the blinds are $10 and $20, the winner may take home around $190 (depending on the rake) while the second place finisher may receive around $110. The payouts for other places vary accordingly, with the lowest-ranking player typically receiving around 10% of the total pot size. 

Some poker variants have higher or lower payouts than those outlined above. For example, heads-up no limit Texas Hold 'em has a much higher payout percentage for first place than traditional nine-player games since there is only one other player involved. Omaha hi/lo has a lower payout percentage than most other poker variants since it is a split pot game. 

In short, there is no one set answer to this question as poker payout percentages can vary greatly depending on the variant being played and the stakes involved. However, using general payout percentages as a guideline can give you an idea of what to expect when playing different variants of poker.
